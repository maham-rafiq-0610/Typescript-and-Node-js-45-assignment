// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// making a programming languages array

let programmingLanguages:string[] = ["TypeScript", "Python", "JavaScript", "PHP",];
